## Traffic Forecasting Using Time-series Analysis


The goal of this project is to implement forecasting models to predict the volume of road traffic within 24 hours.  

We will develop several models (including ARIMA) then we compare the performances to select the best algorithm for each route


#  <i class="fas fa-cogs"></i> Data Preparation 

## The dataset 

We use R [readr](https://readr.tidyverse.org/) package which is part of tidyverse, then we display the first 20 rows :   

```{r eval=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}

# read the data and store it in the dataframe named dataset
dataset <- read_csv("dataset (1).csv")

```

In this project we are using the [reactable](https://glin.github.io/reactable/) package to display all tables  

```{r}

# display using reactable with some options  
reactable(dataset %>% head(20),
          bordered = TRUE, highlight = TRUE, 
          defaultColDef = colDef( headerStyle = list(background = "#4285F4")),
          defaultPageSize = 4 )
```


lets check the colums types 

```{r}
# overview of tha data 
glimpse(dataset)
```

at first sight we find : 

- There is __60 168__  observations and __29__ columns 

- The columns `date` and `time` are of type `charachter`, so we need to concactenat them then convert to `timestamp`

- There is no ID column for the road : we need to create one. 

- We identifie the column `Total Vehicles` as target variable 



Let inspect the `road_name` variable and see the list of unique road names 

```{r}


dataset %>% 
  distinct(road_name) %>%  # get distinct road name 
  arrange(road_name) %>%  # order by names then display 
  reactable(highlight = TRUE,defaultPageSize = 5, # display the dable 
            defaultColDef = colDef( headerStyle = list(background = "#4285F4")))

```

As we can see this column contains 111 road name but we notice that some names are implicitly duplicated because of abbreviations and writing errors: for example : Abbotsford Street vs Abbottsford Street, Domain St vs Domain Street

In total, we have identified 4 errors that we will correct manually, in biggest dataset we can use the Levenshtein distance or advanced NLP techniques can be used to do this work.  

To process the dates we use the lubridate package

We build our target variable y as the aggregation of road traffic per road and per hour


```{r}
dataset %>%
  mutate(road_name= case_when(
    road_name%in%c("Abbotsford Street", "Abbottsford Street")~"Abbottsford Street",  # equivalent if then 
    road_name%in%c("Domain St", "Domain Street")~"Domain Street", # equivalent if then 
    road_name%in%c("Stubbs street", "Stubbs Street")~"Stubbs Street", # equivalent if then 
    road_name%in%c("Wells St", "Walsh Street")~"Walsh Street", # equivalent if then 
    T~road_name # in all other cases render the correspanding road name 
  ) ) %>%
  mutate(date= dmy_hms(paste0(date, time)  )) %>% # create timestamp column using the function dmy_hms from lubridate and  paste0 allow concatenation of strings 
  select(road_name, date, `Total Vehicles`) %>%  # selecting important columns 
  group_by(road_name, date) %>%
  summarise(y= sum(`Total Vehicles`,na.rm = T )) %>% # calculate target variable by road and date 
  head(10) %>% # show only 10 first row 
  reactable(highlight = T,defaultPageSize = 5, 
            defaultColDef = colDef( headerStyle = list(background = "#4285F4")))
```


Now lets check the historical data for each road :

-  we calculate the minimum and maximum date per route
-  the number of hours expected between these two dates ( the diffrence in hours unite)
-  the number of hours in the dataset 
-  finnaly we select only roads with complete data ( `expected_rows`==`n_rows` )

```{r eval=FALSE}
dataset %>%
  mutate(road_name= case_when(
    road_name%in%c("Abbotsford Street", "Abbottsford Street")~"Abbottsford Street",  # equivalent if then 
    road_name%in%c("Domain St", "Domain Street")~"Domain Street", # equivalent if then 
    road_name%in%c("Stubbs street", "Stubbs Street")~"Stubbs Street", # equivalent if then 
    road_name%in%c("Wells St", "Walsh Street")~"Walsh Street", # equivalent if then 
    T~road_name # in all other cases render the correspanding road name 
  ) ) %>%
  mutate(date= dmy_hms(paste0(date, time)  )) %>% # create timestamp column using the function dmy_hms from lubridate and  paste0 allow concatenation of strings 
  select(road_name, date, `Total Vehicles`) %>%  # selecting important columns 
  group_by(road_name, date) %>%
  summarise(y= sum(`Total Vehicles`,na.rm = T )) %>% # calculate target variable by road and date 
  ungroup() %>%  # we ungroup the dataframe then group by road name 
  group_by(road_name) %>% 
  summarise(
    min_date = min(date), # minimum date by road 
    max_date = max(date), # maximum date by road 
    n_rows = n() # total number of records 
  ) %>% 
  mutate(expected_rows =as.integer(difftime(max_date,min_date, units = "hours"))+1) %>% #expect number of hours 
  filter(expected_rows==n_rows) -> clean_road # get only roads with complete data  and save the result in the dataframe clean_road 


 
  
```

```{r}
# display the clean dataframe 
 reactable(clean_road,highlight = T,defaultPageSize = 5, 
            defaultColDef = colDef( headerStyle = list(background = "#4285F4")))
```


## Visualiziation 

After this first stage of data cleaning, we can visualize the temporal evolution of the traffic by road using the `apexchart` package and the `shiny` package to interaction purpose. 


You can change the road using the selector in the top of the graph

```{r echo=FALSE}

df<- dataset %>%
  mutate(road_name= case_when(
    road_name%in%c("Abbotsford Street", "Abbottsford Street")~"Abbottsford Street",
    road_name%in%c("Domain St", "Domain Street")~"Domain Street",
    road_name%in%c("Stubbs street", "Stubbs Street")~"Stubbs Street",
    road_name%in%c("Wells St", "Walsh Street")~"Walsh Street",
    T~road_name
  ) ) %>%
  mutate(date=  dmy_hms(paste0(date, time)  )) %>% 
  filter(road_name%in%clean_road$road_name) %>% # keep only the the road with clean data 
  select(road_name, date, `Total Vehicles`) %>% 
  group_by(road_name, date) %>%
  summarise(y= sum(`Total Vehicles`,na.rm = T )) 

# select input to choose the road name 
fluidRow(
    pickerInput(
    inputId = "road_name",
    label = "Choose a road name",
    choices = unique(df$road_name)
  )
)

# render the interactive plot 
fluidRow(
  apexchartOutput('plot',width = "100%")
)


# build the interactive chart 
output$plot <- renderApexchart({
  
apex(data = df[df$road_name==input$road_name,] %>% mutate(date=as.POSIXct(date)),
     type = "area", mapping = aes(x = date, y = y)) %>% 
  ax_fill(
          type='gradient',
          gradient=list (
            shadeIntensity= 1,
            inverseColors=F,
            opacityFrom=0.5,
            opacityTo= 0,
            stops= c(0, 90, 100)
          )
 
  )
  
    })
```


As we can see on the different graphs, the seasonality is very strong, and all the series seem stationary



#  <i class="fas fa-chart-line"></i> Forecasting  {.tabset}


In this part we will forecast traffic by road using __5 models__: `ARIMA`, `ETS`,  `SNAIVE`, `PROPHET` and the last one is the combinaison of all models.
We will use the following packages :

<div align="center" >
<img src="packages.PNG"> 
</div>



- [fable](https://github.com/tidyverts/fable) : provides a collection of commonly used univariate and multivariate time series forecasting models including exponential smoothing via state space models and automatic ARIMA modelling. These models work within the fable framework, which provides the tools to evaluate, visualise, and combine models in a workflow consistent with the tidyverse.

- [prophet](https://facebook.github.io/prophet/) : is open source software released by Facebook's Core Data Science team.It works best with time series that have strong seasonal effects and several seasons of historical data
 
 
 
 We start by converting the data table to tsibble format and initiate a `future` with `multisession` plan to parallelize calculations 
 
```{r eval=F}
# setup parallel backend 
library(future) 
plan(multisession)
```
 
```{r eval=FALSE}
# we convert the dataframe to a tsibble where the index is the date and the key id the road name 
sdf <- df %>% 
  ungroup() %>% 
  as_tsibble(key = "road_name", index = 'date' )  

```
 



##  &#x1F4C8;  Single time series


Although the _fable_ package is designed to handle many time series, we will be begin by demonstrating its use on a single time series. For this purpose, we will extract the traffic data of Agnes Street 

```{r eval=FALSE}
Agnes <- sdf %>%
  filter(
    road_name == "Agnes Street",
  )
```


For this data set, we include all models  in a single call to the `model()` function like this.


```{r eval=FALSE}
Agnes %>% 
  model(
    arima = ARIMA(y), # fit best ARIMA model using auto.arima 
    ets = ETS(y) , # fit the best ETS model
    snaive = SNAIVE(y), # fit seasonal naive model 
    prophet = prophet(y~ season("day")+season("week")+season("year")) # fit prophet with multiple seasons
  ) %>% 
  mutate(
    mixed = (ets + arima  + snaive +prophet) / 4
  )-> models
```

```{r}
print(models) 
```



The returned object is called a _mable_ or model table, where each cell corresponds to a fitted model. Because we have only fitted models to one time series, this mable has only one row.

To forecast all models, we pass the object to the `forecast` function with the horizon of 24 hours 

```{r eval=FALSE}
fc <- models %>%
  forecast(h = 24)
```



```{r}
print(fc)
```

The return object is a "fable" or forecast table with the following characteristics:

- the __.model__ column becomes an additional key;
- the __y__ column contains the estimated probability distribution of the response variable in future time periods;
- the __.mean__ column contains the point forecasts equal to the mean of the probability distribution.

Now, lets plot 24h forecasts provided by all models ( you can select/deselect models in the plot ) 

```{r echo=FALSE}


apex(data = fc %>% as.data.frame() %>% select(-y) %>%
       mutate(.mean=round(.mean)) %>% 
       rbind(Agnes %>% as.data.frame() %>% 
               mutate(.model='historical') %>% 
               rename( .mean=y)
               ), type = "area", mapping = aes(x = date, y = .mean, group=.model)) %>% 
  ax_fill(
          type='gradient',
          gradient=list (
            shadeIntensity= 1,
            inverseColors=F,
            opacityFrom=0.5,
            opacityTo= 0,
            stops= c(0, 90, 100)
          )
 
  ) %>% 
  ax_legend(position = "right") %>% 
  ax_tooltip(
      enabled= T,
      shared= T
  )


```




##  &#x26A1; All time  series


To scale this up to include all series in the traffic data set requires no more work — we use exactly the same code.

```{r eval=FALSE}


sdf %>% 
  model(
    arima = ARIMA(y),
    ets = ETS(y) ,
    snaive = SNAIVE(y),
    prophet = prophet(y~ season("day")+season("week")+season("year")),
  ) %>% 
  mutate(
    mixed = (ets + arima + snaive +prophet) / 4
  )-> all_models

```


Now the mable includes models for every road

```{r}
print(all_models)
```



```{r eval=FALSE}
all_fc <- all_models %>%
  forecast(h = 24)
```


```{r}
print(all_fc)
```


```{r echo=FALSE}
fluidRow(
    pickerInput(
    inputId = "road_name2",
    label = "Choose a road name",
    selected ="Abbottsford Street", 
    choices = unique(df$road_name)
  )
)

fluidRow(
  apexchartOutput('plot2',width = "100%")
)


output$plot2 <- renderApexchart({

apex(data = all_fc %>% as.data.frame() %>%
       filter(road_name==input$road_name2) %>% 
       select(-y) %>%
       mutate(.mean=round(.mean)) %>% 
       rbind(sdf %>% as.data.frame() %>% 
               filter(road_name==input$road_name2) %>% 
               mutate(.model='historical') %>% 
               rename( .mean=y)
               ), type = "area", mapping = aes(x = date, y = .mean, group=.model)) %>% 
  ax_fill(
          type='gradient',
          gradient=list (
            shadeIntensity= 1,
            inverseColors=F,
            opacityFrom=0.5,
            opacityTo= 0,
            stops= c(0, 90, 100)
          )
 
  ) %>% 
  ax_legend(position = "right") %>% 
  ax_tooltip(
      enabled= T,
      shared= T
  )

    })


```





##  &#x1F3AF; Accuracy calculations


<div align="center" >
<img src="traintest.PNG"> 
</div>

To compare the forecast accuracy of these models, we will create a training data set containing all data except the last 24 hours. We will then forecast the remaining hours in the data set and compare the results with the actual values.



```{r eval=FALSE}

sdf %>% 
  group_by(road_name) %>% 
  slice(1:(n()-24)) %>%  # train the models in the data exept the last 24 hours 
  ungroup() %>% 
  model(
    arima = ARIMA(y),
    ets = ETS(y) ,
    snaive= SNAIVE(y),
    prophet = prophet(y~ season("day")+season("week")+season("year"))
  ) %>% 
  mutate(
    mixed = (ets + arima + snaive +prophet) / 4
  )-> models_train


# Forecast the remaning 24 hours in each road 
fabletools::forecast( object = models_train, sdf %>% 
                        group_by(road_name) %>% 
                        slice((n()-24):n()) %>% ungroup() ) -> fc_train




```



```{r echo=FALSE}

# choosing the road interactively 
fluidRow(
    pickerInput(
    inputId = "road_name3",
    label = "Choose a road name",
    selected ="Abbottsford Street", 
    choices = unique(df$road_name)
  )
)

fluidRow(
  apexchartOutput('plot3',width = "100%")
)


output$plot3 <- renderApexchart({

apex(data = fc_train %>% as.data.frame() %>%
       filter(road_name==input$road_name3) %>% 
       select(-y) %>%
       mutate(.mean=round(.mean)) %>% 
       rbind(sdf %>%
               ungroup() %>% 
               as.data.frame() %>% 
               filter(road_name==input$road_name3) %>% 
               mutate(.model='historical') %>% 
               rename( .mean=y)
               ), type = "area", mapping = aes(x = date, y = .mean, group=.model)) %>% 
  ax_fill(
          type='gradient',
          gradient=list (
            shadeIntensity= 1,
            inverseColors=F,
            opacityFrom=0.5,
            opacityTo= 0,
            stops= c(0, 90, 100)
          )
 
  ) %>% 
  ax_legend(position = "right") %>% 
  ax_tooltip(
      enabled= T,
      shared= T
  )

    })
```



### Forecast errors


Now to check the accuracy, we use the `accuracy()` function. 

A forecast "error" is the difference between an observed value and its forecast. Here "error" does not mean a mistake, it means the unpredictable part of an observation. 

We can measure forecast accuracy by summarising the forecast errors in different ways.

The two most commonly used scale-dependent measures are based on the absolute errors or squared errors:
Mean absolute error: __MAE__ and Root mean squared error: __RMSE__

When comparing forecast methods applied to a single time series, or to several time series with the same units, the MAE is popular as it is easy to both understand and compute. A forecast method that minimises the MAE will lead to forecasts of the median, while minimising the RMSE will lead to forecasts of the mean. Consequently, the RMSE is also widely used, despite being more difficult to interpret.

__Percentage errors__
The Percentage errors have the advantage of being unit-free, and so are frequently used to compare forecast performances between data sets. 
Measures based on percentage errors have the disadvantage of being infinite or undefined if $yt=0$ for any $t$ in the period of interest, and having extreme values if any $yt$ is close to zero.


```{r eval=F}
fabletools::accuracy(fc_train, sdf) %>% select( .model, road_name, .type, RMSE, MAE, MAPE)  -> res 
```

You can filter road and get the metrics by typing the name in `search`  

```{r}
reactable(
  res %>% mutate(MAE= round(MAE, 2),RMSE= round(RMSE, 2)) %>% arrange(road_name), 
  defaultColDef = colDef( headerStyle = list(background = "#4285F4")),
  searchable = T,defaultPageSize = 5,highlight = T)
```
